      <h2>Why Perplexing Pegasus?</h2>
      <p> What is a perplexing pegasus? I couldn't tell you, from what I can recall it is a song by this one group of <q>musicians</q> named Rae Sremmurd. 
         I don't even think this group produces their own music, but thats the title of one of their songs. 
         In all honesty it's not that good but I can still <b>vibe</b> with it. So why perplexing pegasus? because it rhymes. 
         I dont even think pegasus exists but what do I know, I've never seen one so I can only prove by contradiction that it does no exist.
      </p>

         Who are these people and how do you even begin to say that name? It's quite easy actually. 
         Here's the kicker, Rae Sremmurd is actually <em>Ear Drummers</em> backwords. Crazy right? Totally blew my mind when I found out 
         I think 4 years ago. So who are they? I couldn't really tell you since I dont care much about musicians personal lives. 
         I just listen to their music and nothing more. One time they did say "money makes the world go round, money makes the world go down"
         14 year old me thought that was so deep though.

         What does this have to do with Perplexing Pegasus and the artist for the song? I'll contextualize for you, because I am alive
         I am able to experience this waste of my time called a song. It is the fact that I am able to experience something outside of myself
         that I can interpret as music that I can even give my own opinion about said song. Is there a reason for it? I don't think so but what do I know?
         I'm just adding filler to show a theme for this website I am buidling and designing. Think of it as those newspapers actors read in movies.
         If you actually freeze the frame and try to read the article, you will quickly find it's a bunch of meaningless gibberish. Just like life.
         So enjoy it and stop worrying so much about the contents of it. In one of their hit songs Rae Sremmurd said, <q>Money makes the world go 'round,
         money makes the world go down.</q> So even they understand the malevilence of money and how it distroyes everything.
